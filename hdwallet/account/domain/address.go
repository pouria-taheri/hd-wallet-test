// Address is an interface type for any type of destination a transaction
// output may spend to.  This includes pay-to-pubkey (P2PK), pay-to-pubkey-hash
// (P2PKH), and pay-to-script-hash (P2SH).  Address is designed to be generic
// enough that other kinds of addresses may be added in the future without
// changing the decoding and encoding API.

	// converting pubkeys to P2PKH addresses) before encoding as a
